## Day 7: September 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
- Display following and follwers count
- Refactor
- Began work on editing a recipe if you are the one who made it. But I need to rename 'user' in the recipe collection (user is the author of the recipe), to chef.
This is because I need to compare user(chef) with the user from the authContext and they can not have the same name...

**Thoughts**:
